With this mod you will be able to decide when do you want to destroy the dam or when do you want to collapse the cinder tower. (best if you use this mod skiping the mask secuence)

I was trying to add a keybind to initiate the stranger departure but if i do that the sound of solar sails opening just won't stop idk why

Use numpad 2 to destroy the dam and numpad 3 to collapse the tower
